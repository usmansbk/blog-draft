When you hear the word Redux, the next thing that comes to mind is probably React. But you don't need to know React to learn Redux. You can use Redux with any UI including basic HTML. Most people find Redux difficult because they don't understand what it's trying to solve, and how it iswas designed.

Like all well designed libraries and frameworks, Redux too is a combination of design patterns.

- Observer Pattern
- Command Pattern
- State Pattern
- Mediator Pattern

Design Patterns are shared vocabulary. By understanding these design patterns we will finally understand the thought process of Redux creator. Don't worry if you don't know these patterns, as we'll learn them in this tutorial.

For a gentle intro to the Observer Pattern, check out my previous post, [To-Do List with Observer Pattern](https://dev.to/devusman/to-do-list-with-observer-pattern-1cl7). It'll help give you a good mental model of the pattern.

In this Redux tutorial, you will learn how redux works by building a simple Redux clone step by step. Doing this will help you in demystifying the library.
