In this Redux tutorial, you will learn how redux works by building a simple Redux clone step by step. Doing this will help you in demystifying the library.

## Prerequisites

Before you go ahead with this tutorial, please make sure you have a basic understanding of the Observer Pattern (also know as Publisher/Subscriber pattern). If you don't, then read my previous post where I explained the pattern by building a simple todo app.

This is what the final work will look like.
