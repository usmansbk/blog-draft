As JavaScript programmers, we've learned that almost everything is an Object other than the six primitive types â€” `null`, `undefined`, `string`, `number`, `boolean`, and `symbols`.

In this article, I'll show you the different ways we use JavaScript Objects.

## Structure Object

This is a structure. A structure contains unrelated data.

```js
const structure = {
    firstName: "Zorro",
    catSound: "Meow",
    rotatePlanet: function () {
        console.log("Too lazy");
    },
};
```
