## Personal Blog by Usman

Hello everyone, my name is Usman and my goals are beyound your comprehension. XD Just kidding! I have a goal to work for a tech company and build projects that helps people.

For the past 3 years, I have gained the knowledge of principles, patterns, and practices that a craftsman knows. I have grinded these knowledge into my muscles and soul by building 3 strong user interfaces and backend servers.

Currently, I am studying at Microverse, an online training school where I code 8 hours a day remotely with other developers around the world and have learned the skills of communication and teamwork.

I am really excited about the opportunity to work remotely with a tech company.
